- Keep accessibility in mind (ARIA labels, semantic structure)

### CSS
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use the project's color variables where applicable
- Comment complex selectors
- Organize styles logically (by component or section)
- Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ syntax where appropriate
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Test functionality across different devices

### Responsive Design
- Test on multiple screen sizes:
  - Mobile: 320px - 767px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1024px
